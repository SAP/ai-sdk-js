# @sap-ai-sdk/orchestration

This package provides generative AI orchestration capabilities, integrating seamlessly with SAP AI Core and SAP AI Launchpad to enhance your AI workflows.

### Installation

```
$ npm install @sap-ai-sdk/orchestration
```

## Prerequisites

- [Enable the AI Core service in BTP](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/initial-setup).
- Project configured with Node.js v20 or higher and native ESM support enabled.
- For testing your application locally:
  - Download a service key for your AI Core service instance.
  - Create a `.env` file in the sample-code directory.
  - Add an entry `AICORE_SERVICE_KEY='<content-of-service-key>'`.

## Orchestration Client

The orchestration client provides essential features like templating and content filtering, which are often required in business AI scenarios:

- **Templating** allows composing prompts with placeholders that can be filled during a chat completion request.
- **Content filtering** lets you restrict the type of content sent to or received from a generative AI model.

To interact with generative AI models compatible with the orchestration service, use the orchestration client.
More details about orchestration are available [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/orchestration-workflow).

To utilize orchestration capabilities, you need to create a deployment.
Once the deployment is complete, you'll have a `deploymentUrl` to access the orchestration service.
For details, see [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-orchestration).

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are in place:

- At least one orchestration-compatible deployment for a generative AI model is running.
  - You can use the [`DeploymentApi`](../ai-api/README.md#deploymentapi) from `@sap-ai-sdk/ai-api` to deploy a model to the SAP generative AI hub. For more information, see [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-generative-ai-model-in-sap-ai-core).
- A deployment for orchestration is created. For details, see [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-orchestration).
- The `@sap-ai-sdk/orchestration` package is installed in your project.

### Orchestration Client

Use the orchestration client to configure different modules like templating and content filtering along with sending chat completion requests to an orchestration compatible generative AI model.

You can pass configuration information like for example the LLM to be used for inference and template, as a parameter to the client.

#### Orchestration client with Templating

Use the Orchestration client with templating to pass a prompt with placeholders, that can be filled during a chat completion request with the input parameters.

This feature enables you to vary the prompt based on the input parameters.

```TS
import { OrchestrationClient } from '@sap-ai-sdk/orchestration';

const orchestrationClient = new OrchestrationClient({
  llm: {
    model_name: 'gpt-4-32k',
    model_params: { max_tokens: 50, temperature: 0.1 }
  },
  templating: {
    template: [
      { role: 'user', content: 'What is the capital of {{?country}}?' }
    ]
  }
});

const response = await orchestrationClient.chatCompletion({
  inputParams: { country: 'France' }
});

const responseContent = response.getContent();
```

It is possible to provide a history of a conversation to the model.
Use the following snippet to send a chat completion request with history and a system message:

```TS
import { OrchestrationClient } from '@sap-ai-sdk/orchestration';

const orchestrationClient = new OrchestrationClient({
  llm: {
    model_name: 'gpt-4-32k',
    model_params: { max_tokens: 50, temperature: 0.1 }
  },
  templating: {
    template: [
      { role: 'user', content: 'What is my name?' }
    ],
    messages_history: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: 'You are a helpful assistant who remembers all details the user shares with you.'
      },
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: 'Hi! I am Bob'
      },
      {
        role: 'assistant',
        content: 'Hi Bob, nice to meet you! I am an AI assistant. I will remember that your name is Bob as we continue our conversation.'
      }
    ]
  }
});

const responseContent = await orchestrationClient.chatCompletion().getContent();
const tokenUsage = response.getTokenUsage();

logger.info(
  `Total tokens consumed by the request: ${tokenUsage.total_tokens}\n` +
  `Input prompt tokens consumed: ${tokenUsage.prompt_tokens}\n` +
  `Output text completion tokens consumed: ${tokenUsage.completion_tokens}\n`
);
```

#### Orchestration client with Content Filtering

Use the Orchestration client with filtering to restrict the type of content that is passed to and received from a generative AI model.

This feature enables you always filter both input and the output of a model based on content safety criteria.

```TS
import { OrchestrationClient } from '@sap-ai-sdk/orchestration';

const filter = buildAzureContentFilter({ Hate: 2, Violence: 4 });
const orchestrationClient = new OrchestrationClient({
  llm: {
    model_name: 'gpt-4-32k',
    model_params: { max_tokens: 50, temperature: 0.1 }
  },
  templating: {
    template: [{ role: 'user', content: '{{?input}}' }]
  },
  filtering: {
    input: filter,
    output: filter
  }
});

try {
  const response = await orchestrationClient.chatCompletion({
    inputParams: { input: 'I hate you!' }
  });
  return response.getContent();
} catch (error: any) {
  return `Error: ${error.message}`;
}
```

The Azure Content Filter supports four categories: `Hate`, `Violence`, `Sexual`, and `SelfHarm`. Each category can be configured with severity levels of 0, 2, 4, or 6.
