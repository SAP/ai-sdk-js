            <p> The "maxpagesize" preference and the "continueToken" parameter together
            enable splitting a large list of resourcegroups to small chunks. This feature
            can help to reduce the response time of a single list-resourcegroup request
            when the client has a large number resourcegroups in the system.

            <p> By default, the "maxpagesize" is not set, which means retrieving all
            resourcegroups in a single request.

            <p> Setting a maxpagesize may return fewer than the requested amount of
            resourcegroups (up to zero) in the event all requested resourcegroups are
            filtered out. The client should only use the presence of the Link header
            in the response to determine whether more resourcegroups are available.
            If "maxpagesize" is specified and the response does not include a Link header,
            the client may assume that no more resourcegroups are available.
