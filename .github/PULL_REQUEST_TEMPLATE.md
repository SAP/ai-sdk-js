## Context

Closes SAP/ai-sdk-js-backlog#ISSUENUMBER.

- [ ] I know which base branch I chose for this PR, as the default branch is `v1-main` now, which is not for v2 development.
- [ ] If my change will be merged into the `main` branch (for v2), I've updated (v2-Upgrade-Guide.md)[./v2-Upgrade-Guide.md] in case my change has any implications for users updating to SDK v2
