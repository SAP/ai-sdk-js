## SAP Cloud SDK for AI Sample Project

We have created a sample project demonstrating the different clients' usage of the SAP Cloud SDK for AI for TypeScript/JavaScript.
The [project README](https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-js/blob/main/sample-code/README.md) outlines the set-up needed to build and run it locally.

## Local Testing

To test SAP Cloud SDK for AI features locally during application development, follow these steps:

1. Download a service key for the AI Core service instance.
2. Set the downloaded service key as the `AICORE_SERVICE_KEY` environment variable in the local environment.

The SDK parses the service key from the environment variable to interact with the AI Core service.
This setup enables local testing of clients such as orchestration and OpenAI, provided that deployments for orchestration and OpenAI exist in SAP BTP.
