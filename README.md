## Requirements and Setup

_Insert a short description what is required to get your project running..._

## Running tests

If you're using the Jest Runner extension in Visual Studio Code, you'll need to add the following settings to your `settings.json` file before running the tests from VSCode:

```
 "jestrunner.debugOptions": {
    "runtimeArgs": ["--experimental-vm-modules"]
  },
  "jestrunner.jestCommand": "NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules node 'node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js'",
```

You can run our tests either with:
```
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:type
```

or use the jest runnner extension directly from your IDE.


### Running E2E tests locally

Before running the E2E tests, ensure that you have a `.env` file located in `tests/e2e-tests` folder.

Inside the `.env` file, define an `AICORE_SERVICE_KEY` variable and initialize it with the service binding of `aicore`. You can obtain this binding from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable or from the service key defined in your BTP subaccount.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```
pnpm test:e2e
```
