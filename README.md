## SAP Cloud SDK for AI Sample Project

We have created a sample project demonstrating the different clients' usage of the SAP Cloud SDK for AI for TypeScript/JavaScript. The [project README](./sample-code/README.md) outlines the set-up needed to build and run it locally.

### OpenAI client

The OpenAI client can be used to send chat completion or embedding requests to the OpenAI model deployed in SAP Generative AI Hub.

#### Prerequisites

- A deployed OpenAI model in AI Core.
  - [How to deploy a model to AI Core](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-generative-ai-model-in-sap-ai-core)
  - <details><summary>An example deployed model from the AI Core <code>/deployments</code> endpoint</summary>

#### Install the required packages

```bash
# install foundation models package
npm install @sap-ai-sdk/foundation-models
```

#### Simple Chat completion

```TS
const client = new OpenAiChatClient({ deploymentId: 'd123456abcdefg' });
const response = await client.run({
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'Where is the deepest place on earth located'
        }
      ]
    })
```

It is also possible to create a chat client by passing a `modelName`instead of the `deploymentId`.
